I'm **Nishant Bansal**

I work on **Bitcoin Lightning Network security**, with a focus on:
- Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks
- Vulnerability research and responsible disclosure
- Protocol fuzzing

Most of the work shared here is based on:
- Fuzzing Lightning implementations (LND, Core Lightning, LDK, Eclair)
- Differential fuzzing by comparing protocol behavior against specs
- Manual code audits and targeted reviews of security-critical paths
